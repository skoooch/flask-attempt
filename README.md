# flask-blog-site
Used this project to learn a bit about web development and database usage.

You can register, login and make posts.

Currently working on making comment sections and other interactive stuff.

The run the website on your local device, download all files, open a console in flask-blog-site/flask blog/ and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Then run `run.py` in your python console, and go to http://localhost:5555/home
